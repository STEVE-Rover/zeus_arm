#### workspace.m
This matlab script plots the robot's workspace using MatLAB's Robotic ToolBox. It was done to validate the arm's reach, which was determined by the team to be 1,3 meters in order to reach every possible position in the arm's workspace for the Dexterity mission.
The following images are the output generated by the script. The second image gives the highest point that the arm can be fixed on the rover from the ground in order to be able to pick up objects on the ground.
